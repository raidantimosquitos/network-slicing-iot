Vehicular communications mainly address communications and networking issues in a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) manner, this includes:\nVehicle-to-vehicle (V2V). Vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P). Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). Vehicle-to-network (V2N). Use cases of network slicing in smart transportation. # V2X communications enable a diversity of vehicular applications, the survey studies four main use cases and analyse their critical requirements.\nLocalization and navigation: localization services are required by many sensors, vehicles and pedestrians that collect sensory data. These require synchronization and timestamps, usual technologies are GNSS, radar, LIDAR and infrarred (IR). Driving/Transportation safety: V2X communications must guarantee timely delivery of warning messages to avoid traffic accidents. Autonomous driving: V2X communications play a critical role, since autonomous vehicles must connect to infrastructure to exchange information (e.g. navigation information, map, localization, traffic status, etc.) Infotainment services: Continuously new vehicles support more screens and systems for in-car entertainment, this will be accentuated by autonomous vehicles. Infotainment services raise critical requirements on V2X communications (e.g. high data-rate for HD video streaming) Critical requirements # The following table summarizes the critical requirements for each of the services described in the previous section.\nUse cases Latency Data-rate Reliability Data storage/cache Computing Security Localization and navigation 10 ms ~ 100 ms 1 Mbps low to high ⭐⭐ ⭐⭐ low to high Driving/Transportation safety 50 ms ~ 100 ms 1 Mbps 99.9% ⭐ ⭐ high Autonomous driving 1ms 10 Mbps close to 100% ⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ high Infotainment services up to 100 ms 15 Mbps low to high ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐ low to medium Data storage/cache and computing range from 1 to 5, from less to more resource requirements.\nNetwork slicing architecture # To fulfill the requirements of the four applications described earlier within the same network infrastructure the following network slicing architecture has been proposed.\nThe top four layers or slices (one per application) of the network make use of the resources provided by the infrastructure layer, in order to fulfill all their critical requirements. The lowest layer is the infrastructure layer, it consists of communication resources as well as computing resources. Communication resources: DSRC, 4G cellular networks, 5G cellular networks. Computing resources: facilities provided by remote cloud service providers and data centers, edge/fog computing facilities deployed at eNodeB and gNodeB, closely approximated to UEs and vehicles. Key enabling technologies # Network slicing of smart transportation heavily depends on two supportive technologies: NFV and SDN.\nNFV: can create multiple virtualized network instances from a sole network infrastructure. Achieves flexible deployment and elastic network services for transportation scenarios. SDN: makes network functions (NF) be programmable and dynamically adjust network traffic flows to fulfill the emerging demands of diverse transportation applications. Network slice orchestration and management. # Orchestration of diverse NFV and SDN services is a necessity, thus a network slice orchestration architecture is presented.\nNetwork slice orchestration architecture for smart transportation # The architecture consists of the following components:\nNetwork infrastructure virtualization. Infrastructure providers provide different hardware resources (communications, networking, computing and storage). Two types of infrastructure providers: Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), maintain and manage physical resources. Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), lease and manage virtual resources (VNFs) being virtually created by MNOs. The hardware resources can be virtualized through computing virtualization (Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers and NFV. These virtualized resources form VNF pools. Network slice layer. Each network slice is implemented by underlying network infrastructure virtualization services. Example: Autonomous driving network slice is composed of a number of virtual or physical network functions (VNFs or PNFs). The survey categorizes them into: Computing-related VNFs/PNFs For autonomous driving, it includes authentication management and cruise services, since security and self-driving authentication are crucial requirements. Network-related VNFs/PNFs For autonomous driving, it includes mobility management (MM) and radio resource management (RRM) because it has critical requirements on communications. Both computing and network related VNFS/PNFs need to be properly controlled by SDN controllers. Operation Support System (OSS) and Business Support System (BSS). Middleware between the underlying network slices and the tenants. OSS/BSS offer slice descriptions to tenants who may redefine their requirements. SLAs can be reached after several rounds of negotiation. Management ANd Orchestration (MANO). VNF managers monitor and supervise the VNF pool. Can provide tenants with a predefined slice template to simplify user\u0026rsquo;s decision-making. Slice orchestrator may interact with OSS/BSS for fulfilling requirements defined in the SLAs. Slice orchestrator also communicates with the slice manager per slice to further tailor functions of the slice. AI assisted management and operation # Although the network slice orchestration architecture described above facilitates network slice management, it is challenging to efficiently manage various network/computing resources to fulfill the dynamically-varied user demands.\nPhysical hardware network/computing facilities or VNFs may suffer from various failures, malfunctions or malicious attacks. Dynamically-changing topologies of vehicular networks make difficult managing the network infrastructure resources. Smart transportation applications can vary in complexity (driving-safety application vs infotainment services, web browsing vs 4K video streaming) The recent advances in big data analytics and AI can help tackle the above three difficulties:\nJiang W. et al. Intelligence Slicing: A Unified Framework to Integrate Artificial Intelligence into 5G Networks Deploying of AI into 5G network slicing framework with two cases to demonstrate the Proof of Concept (PoC). Bega D. et al. Network Slicing Meets Artificial Intelligence: An AI-Based Framework for Slice Management AI-based framework for network slice management, with accents on admission control and dynamic resource allocation. Shen X. et al. AI-Assisted Network-Slicing Based Next-Generation Wireless Networks First proposal to include AI with network slice management demonstrating numerous benefits, such as flexibility of RAN slicing and content-caching managing. MEC-empowered network slicing # Smart transportation applications such as autonomous driving and infotainment services have high computational requirements on computational facilities. DL model for object detection / computer vision needs for autonomous driving require clouds/fog setups equipped with GPUs. MEC/Fog technologies can offload computing/storage tasks from remote servers to nodes such as gNodeBs, eNodeBs and RSUs closer to the computing requirements. Reliability and security # Existing network slicing technologies may not fulfill the close-to-100% reliability, critical for some intelligent vehicular applications. There are several efforts working toward achieving ultra reliable communications. The work analyzed the reliability requirements in SLAs and presented an algorithm to achieve efficient slice allocation and network reliability. Meanwhile, the work proposed an optical underlay network to achieve network slicing with high reliability and low E2E latency. In addition to the adoption of optical networks, Shahriar et al. explored bandwidth squeezing and multi-path provisioning technologies to further improve reliability. In addition to reliability, security is another important issue for network slicing technologies. Security threats cover the entire life cycle of network slicing as well as intra-slice and inter-slice management. Countermeasures against the security threats include the authentication management, access control and authorization, and incorporation of blockchain.
