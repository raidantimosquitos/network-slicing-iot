# Research Project Proposal - Network slicing for Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) networks.

## Research background

Network slicing is a pivotal feature in networks, enabling the creation of multiple virtual networks atop a shared physical infrastructure. Each "slice" is tailored to meet specific application requirements, making this technology especially relevant for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks.

As of February 2025, network slicing has transitioned from a theoretical concept to a practical solution within Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks, driven by the widespread deployment of 5G standalone (SA) architectures. This evolution enables the creation of multiple virtual networks on shared physical infrastructures, each tailored to specific industrial applications.

- **Private 5G networks in smart factories**: Private 5G networks have been deployed to support extensive ecosystems of IIoT devices in smart factories. These networks facilitate real-time data collection and analysis, enabling full automation and the integration of industrial AI. For instance, Toyota Material Handling operates a 200,000 square-foot warehouse with a private 5G network, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity and zero disruptions.

There are three main Industrial Internet-of-Things services in the current state-of-the-art, these are:
- **Smart transportation**.
- **Smart energy grid**.
- **Smart factory/manufacturing**.

The main technologies that enable network slicing are the following:
- **Network Function Virtualization (NFV)**.
- **Software Definded Networking (SDN)**.
- **Virtualization and containerization**.
- **Cloud and Edge computing**.

### Research relevance
- **Customized connectivity**: IIoT applications encompass a wide range of requirements—from ultra-reliable, low-latency communication for real-time control systems to high-bandwidth needs for video surveillance. Network slicing allows operators to allocate dedicated slices optimized for these diverse needs, ensuring that each application functions efficiently without interference.

- **Enhanced security and isolation**: In industrial settings, the security of data transmission is paramount. Network slicing provides isolated virtual networks, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and that operations are insulated from potential threats affecting other slices.

- **Efficient resource utilization**: By dynamically allocating resources based on the specific demands of each slice, network slicing promotes optimal use of the network infrastructure. This flexibility is crucial in IIoT environments where varying workloads and real-time demands are common. [viavisolutions.com](https://www.viavisolutions.com/en-us/5g-network-slicing)
- **Scalability and flexibility**: As IIoT deployments grow, the ability to scale and adapt becomes essential. Network slicing facilitates the rapid provisioning and adjustment of network resources, allowing industries to expand their operations without overhauling existing infrastructure.
