# Smart Manufacturing IIoT Services

- 5G network slicing introduces notable innovations to enable the trend of digitalization in Industry 4.0 and smart factory verticals.
- Factories increasingly rely on network connectivity for introducing new services and achieving better efficiency.
- To accommodate various traffic types, dynamic resource requirements, and time-varying utilization rate arisen from different applications, factory networks press for the abilities of flexibility and isolation.
- The network slicing paradigm exploits the NFV and SDN networking techniques to create multiple logical network instances over a shared network infrastructure.
- Each instance can be adjusted for specific QoS requirements of industrial services and use cases.
- This section focuses on providing an industrial perspective on the concept of network slicing and its usage in smart factory networks.
